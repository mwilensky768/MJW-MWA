Yo dude - chi = mean+5*sigma w/M = 10 worked pretty well (a little underflagged)

Consider feeding this into SIR

Tried M=20, eta > 0.05 ended with massive overflagging
eta = 0.05 extended the flag mask in lower frequency a little too far but nailed the higher frequency end of the flag

iterating seems to make overflagging worse?  Maybe should change chi/eta on iteration???

MAKE SURE TO ASK: Are coarse band edges flagged AFTER or BEFORE SumThreshold??  THERE IS A COMMUTATOR

Baseline 1 or 2 has an interesting fringe pattern over in the far right??

All lines same plot (log-lin)
Sep inside/outside coarse band lines (do this with EMO??)
compare to good obs id
2d time/freq histogram of flags

single baseline waterfall with fringe (real & amp)
explore where flag expansion is happening in freq relative to spectrum/coarse band lines)

Threshold Bands:
0.16-0.24
0.24-1.9

find where 0.24 < bins < 1.9
